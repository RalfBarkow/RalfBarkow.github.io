# Lightweight DITA: An Introduction
## Working Draft 11
Lightweight DITA (LwDITA) is a simplified version of DITA that is designed to ease adoption and implementation of DITA by reducing its dependence on robust XML structures and allowing authors to develop and share content in a variety of markup languages, which include HTL5 and Markdown.

LwDITA provides a subset of the functionality of the full DITA standard. It has a limited element and attribute set and stricter content models.
